## Climate Migration Coordination Simulator

---

## **1. Core Concept**

**You are not the refugee. You are their lifeline.**

Play as Sarah Martinez, a Level-3 Coordinator at the Exodus Coordination Center, guiding multiple climate refugee caravans across a devastated North American continent. Using satellite communications, GPS tracking, and resource allocation networks, you make life-or-death decisions for hundreds of displaced souls seeking safety in climate-resilient zones.

**Genre:** Real-time Strategy / Crisis Management Simulation  
**Platform:** Web Browser (HTML5)  
**Target Audience:** Adults interested in strategic decision-making, crisis management, and narrative-driven gameplay

- **Crisis Response** - Handle emergencies, weather events, and equipment failures
- **Shift Handoff Management** - Prepare detailed briefings and return to assess NPC coordinator performance
- **Relationship Repair** - Rebuild trust with caravan leaders after problematic handoffs

### **Time Management System:**

- **Variable Speed Control** - 1x, 2x, 4x speed with pause functionality
- **Time Scale** - 1 real second = 1 game minute (adjustable)
- **Strategic Pausing** - Stop time for critical decision moments
- **Shift Rotation** - 8-hour coordinator shifts with handoff procedures

---

## **3. Game Mechanics**

### **Communication System**

- **Communication Types:**
  - Radio transmissions with audio cues
  - Email-style status reports
  - Emergency alert broadcasts
  - Weather service warnings
  - Supply depot notifications

### **Multi-Caravan Management**

- **Resource Monitoring** - Food, Water, Fuel, Medicine, Morale for each group
- **Status Updates** - Moving, Resting, Emergency, Shelter, Offline
- **Leader Relationships** - Build trust and rapport with caravan leaders
- **Group Dynamics** - Different caravan personalities and specialties

### **Decision Making**

- **Route Guidance** - Direct caravans through optimal or emergency routes
- **Resource Allocation** - Distribute limited supplies between groups
- **Crisis Response** - Emergency protocols for medical, mechanical, and weather crises
- **Risk Assessment** - Balance speed vs. safety in routing decisions
- **Shift Preparation** - Strategic handoff briefings to minimize NPC coordinator errors
- **Damage Control** - Recovering from mistakes made during off-shift periods

### **Resource Network**

- **Medical Aid** - Deploy medical teams and distribute medicine
- **Fuel Stations** - Manage charging stations and fuel depots
- **Safe Shelters** - Temporary shelter coordination during extreme weather

---

## **4. Shift System & Coordinator Management**

### **Coordinator Human Needs**

- **Fatigue System** - Performance degrades after 10+ hours on shift
- **Stress Levels** - Crisis events and difficult decisions increase stress
- **Mandatory Rest** - Must take 12-hour off-shift breaks (not optional)
- **Personal Stakes** - Coordinator's reputation and career affected by outcomes

### **NPC Coordinator Handoffs**

- **Competency Variance** - Different NPC coordinators have different skill levels and personalities
- **Error Probability** - Chance of mistakes during off-shift (5-25% depending on situation complexity)
- **Personality Conflicts** - Some caravan leaders may prefer/distrust different coordinators
- **Information Filtering** - NPC coordinators may downplay problems, exaggerate successes, or omit critical details

### **Handoff Report System**

- **Pre-Shift Briefing** - Player prepares status reports and priority instructions
- **Post-Shift Debrief** - NPC coordinator provides (potentially inaccurate) shift summary
- **Reality Discovery** - Player discovers actual situation through direct communication with caravans
- **Trust Assessment** - Determine reliability of NPC coordinator reports over time

### **Strategic Implications**

- **Preparation Planning** - Set caravans up for success during anticipated off-shift periods
- **Risk Mitigation** - Position caravans safely before mandatory breaks
- **Relationship Management** - Build strong bonds with caravan leaders who can work with any coordinator
- **Crisis Timing** - Major emergencies during off-shift create complex problem-solving scenarios

- **Character Portraits** - Caravan leaders and key personnel for personal connection

### **Audio Design**

- **Radio Communication** - Static, beeps, voice transmissions
- **Alert System** - Different tones for message priorities and emergencies
- **Ambient Atmosphere** - Terminal hum, distant weather sounds
- **Voice Acting** - Optional voice lines for key messages and emergencies
- **Dynamic Audio Cues** - Audio feedback for all user interactions

---

## **5. Technology Stack**

### **Primary Framework**

- **HTML5 Canvas** - Rendering and visual effects

### **Development Tools**

- **Visual Studio Code** - Primary development environment
- **Git** - Version control
- **Phaser Editor** - Optional visual scene editing

### **Asset Pipeline**

- **Audio:** Web Audio API for dynamic sound generation
- **Graphics:** SVG icons, CSS animations, Phaser graphics API
- **Data:** JSON for caravan data, events, and game configuration

## **6. Game World & Setting**

### **Timeframe:** 2045-2050

Climate change has made large portions of North America uninhabitable. Mass migration is underway as people flee from:

- **Extreme heat zones** (former Southwest)
- **Flooded coastal cities** (former East/West coasts)
- **Drought-devastated farmland** (former Midwest)
- **Wildfire-ravaged forests** (former Pacific Northwest)

### **Safe Zones (Destinations):**

- **New Seattle Climate Zone** - Engineered city with climate domes
